-- Quest notes:
-- The ruins of Solarsal is 6 quests, that all take place on the two western islands.
-- Missing Courier: Leads to shore then back, and eventually to south of Camp Mojache.

-- The Stave of Equinox: Starts in Darnassus, goes to tanaris, then to Hinterlands, then back to Darnassus, then to Feathermoon, then north of Feralas (close to the lost night elf girl), then back to Feathermoon. Probably a waste of time. Gives ~19k XP & a wand as reward
