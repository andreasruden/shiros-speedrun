[D Shiros 1-58 Speedrun for alliance (patch 2.3+)]
[GA Alliance]
[N 1-12 Teldrassil]
[NX 12-15 Darkshore]

[OC] *Some speedrun tips*:
[OC] *Speedrunning is best done with a class that can kill while moving*. Always try to run towards your next objective while killing. And always look to kill/grind while headed somewhere.
[OC] *Melee classes*: By strafing you can kill while moving at full speed.
[OC] [A hunter] *Hunter specific*: Get an auto-shot timer addon. To kill while moving run straight, then simply spin around for an auto shot + instant shot (e.g. arcane shot or serpent sting).
[OC] [A hunter] *Hunter specific (when not on the move)*: Before pet, when a mob reaches melee start auto-shooting another and melee weaving that first mob to min-max kill speed. Can be easily done with a macro:\\*/targetlasttarget\\/startattack\\/use Auto Shot*

[OC] Note: This guide levels skinning and cooking for a bit of a quicker mount. For classes with good MS increase, hunter (up to 38%), druid (40%), shaman (40%), most of these instructions can be skipped for a net-gain in total speed. Same for classes with "free" mounts (paladin, warlock).

XXX: Add food+water buying. Arrow purchasing. Hunter quests.
