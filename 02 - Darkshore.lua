Walk to this [0.07, 77.51 spot].
Swim forward, you will come to more walkable land. We're no longer on the Menethil map but in Menethil, so cannot give coordinates here. If you look at the Dun Morogh map we start walking again at (33, 8).
At (27, 7) in Dun Morogh we start swimming again. Follow the coast line closely.
At (20, 11) in Dun Morogh, just as we get very close to the fatigue area and start turning inwards, start draining your breath to prepare to deathwarp. Don't die before it says "Dun Morogh" on your minimap though!
If you follow the terrain, it will show you as actually in Dun Morogh at (17, 15). This is when it's okay to die :-).
