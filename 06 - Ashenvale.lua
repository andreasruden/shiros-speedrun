[N 22-25 Ashenvale]
[NX X-X XXX]

-- XXX: Maybe we should do the escort and stuff into Ashenvale now instead of earlier? The benefit would be not having to backtrack into Darkshore. We'd also do Maestra's post on the way. But, we still have to go to astranaar to pickup Zoram Strand and Raene's Cleansing before finishing west. So in the end it should not have major difference.
